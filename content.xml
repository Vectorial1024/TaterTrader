  <text language="33" name="TaterTrade" description="TaterTrader est un script de négociation automatique WIP qui tente de générer des profits sans utiliser de tricherie.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Objectif:&#13;&#10;TaterTrader est la tentative de Ludsoe de fournir un script de négociation semi-décent. Il tente de rechercher la meilleure transaction dans le cadre des contraintes que vous avez définies lors de la configuration de l'ordre.&#13;&#10;Ludsoe a tenté de maintenir l'équilibre de TaterTrader, car il ne fait que des transactions dont le joueur a connaissance.&#13;&#10;Caractéristiques:&#13;&#10;Tente de trouver le meilleur profit en fonction des configurations de l'ordre donné.&#13;&#10;Un tas de paramètres que vous pouvez modifier pour ajuster comment et où il négocie.&#13;&#10;Ne négocie qu'avec des offres de transaction connues du joueur.&#13;&#10;Utilise les ordres de transaction intégrés au jeu pour effectuer ses transactions. Lorsque la maison des commerçants est placée sur une station, celle-ci devient le commandant des commerçants. Les commerçants utilisent l'argent de leur commandant s'ils en ont un. Le mode Trader de station vous permet de concentrer le trader sur une station et de gérer toutes ses offres commerciales. Peut être utilisé sur les stations appartenant aux joueurs et aux PNJs, même pour les comptes de construction de stockage des stations.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Options de configuration:&#13;&#10;Vous pouvez définir un secteur ou une station d'origine.&#13;&#10;Peut régler le trader pour qu'il retourne toujours &quot;au secteur ou la station d'origine&quot; avant de tenter de rechercher un autre échange. 13;&#10;Vous pouvez configurer les marchandises pour lesquelles le négociant tente de trouver des accords commerciaux.&#13;&#10;La distance maximale de la maison à laquelle le négociant peut acheter ou vendre.&#13;&#10;Modifier le prix que les négociants perçoivent des marchandises de vos propres stations. (N'affecte pas réellement le coût)&#13;&#10;Vous pouvez configurer les négociants pour contourner les restrictions commerciales des factions.&#13;&#10;Vous pouvez exclure des secteurs de la recherche d'offres commerciales.&#13;&#10;Vous pouvez utiliser des listes de marchandises prédéfinies, j'ai copié celles utilisées par le jeu lui-même. Mais je peux en ajouter en fonction des suggestions.&#13;&#10;Vous pouvez configurer le Trader pour qu'il compare les distances entre les stations lors de la recherche d'offres.&#13;&#10;L'activation du mode Trader de station vous permet de cibler les offres d'une station, ce qui vous permet d'automatiser vos propres stations ou même celles appartenant aux PNJ.&#13;&#10;Vous pouvez interdire le commerce de factions entières, ne plus faire de commerce avec ces fichus pirates et ainsi de ne plus perdre vos traders.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Auteur: Ludsoe&#13;&#10;Maintenance: DeadAir&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Patch notes disponibles sur:&#13;&#10;https://github.com/DeadAirRT&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Le meilleur endroit pour me contacter:&#13;&#10;https://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?f=181&amp;t=415937" author="Ludsoe"></text>
